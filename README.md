#  Naija Game

'Naija Game' is a pice of work I embarked on create a game we commonly play in Niaja while growing up. Also, I have been try to refresh my C++ and OpenGL knowledge, so I thought I'd write a 'game' .

The game uses AI technique based on basic machine learning concept; the program plays humans and  records their moves. It then leverages the "learnt" moves as its knowledge base. So the more games and better players it plays,the better it gets.
